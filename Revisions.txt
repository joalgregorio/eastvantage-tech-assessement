Revisions
- Used prepared sql statements as a step to deter sql injections.
- Implemented encapsulation by declaring variables only used internally by the classes as private.
- Implemented dependency injections.
- Enabled list method for comments to filter results by news Id to prevent negative performance impact and probable information leakage.
- Used a config file instead of hardcoded database credentials. Would recommend that this is used for local development only. Use secrets on shared environments for better security.
- Added error handling.
- Made the following changes in the tables' DDL statments:
    - used plural table names for uniformity and readability.
    - setting NOW() as default value for created_at for both news and comments table.
    - added foreign key in comments to enforce relationship between the news and comments table.
